How Hybrid Search Works in Milvus

This feature enables different columns to:

Represent multiple perspectives of information. For instance, in e-commerce, product images include front, side, and top views. Different views can be represented with different types or dimensions of vectors.

Utilize various types of vector embeddings. This includes dense embeddings from models like BERT and Transformers and sparse embeddings from algorithms like BM25, BGE-M3, and SPLADE.

Support the fusion of multimodal vectors from various unstructured data types such as images, videos, audio, and text files. For example, in criminal investigations, suspects can be represented through biometric modalities such as fingerprints, voiceprints, and facial recognition, aiding in identifying individuals across different modalities.

Support the fusion of vector search and full-text search.
